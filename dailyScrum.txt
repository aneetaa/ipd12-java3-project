DAILY SCRUM - EVERYDAY AT 9AM
=============================

Each member writes down answers to 3 questions:

<current date goes here>

1. What I have done/not done since last scrum?

2. What I plan to do from this scrum to next? (next 24 hours)

3. Where do I need assistance? What do I need to figure out?
